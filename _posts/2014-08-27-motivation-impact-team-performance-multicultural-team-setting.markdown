The advancement of human resource functions has altered organizational activities, employee’s attitudes and their manager’s reactions towards them. Motivating and retaining efficient employees remains a crucial assignment that lies on the ability of the management to identify possible factors that can motivate employees to boost performance (Batchelor, 2010).

This research aims to analyze the impact of motivation on team performance in a multicultural workforce, with the possible factors that can enhance such. Johnson et al., (2005) suggest the need to increasingly motivate employees so as to exploit knowledge, due to increasing dynamism of organizations.

Working with people from diverse culture is complex, hence the need for organizations to acknowledge employee’s motivational level and also information about their culture and perceptions (Halverson and Tirmizi, 2008).

Management should therefore acknowledge that motivating employees increases performance and organizational success. In other to strategically attract, motivate and keep the right employees, managers should identify employee’s expectations from their jobs and regularly evaluate their level of motivation (Sims, 2007).
