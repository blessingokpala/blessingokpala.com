![Some Challenges Encountered by Bloggers](/img/blogging-336376_640-640x300.jpg)

Starting and finding a blog niche is a vital aspect but yet an initial huddle that several new bloggers face. Based on recent discussions I had with some bloggers, it appears that the main problem of blogging is how to bring communicate one’s thoughts and ideas consistently so that the audience can understand, appreciate and pick itself.

Writing is hard but yet an integral part of mankind. Histories couldn’t have existed without writing and there won’t be any future without the act of writing! As bloggers, we derive joy in writing and “creating stories out of nothing” just to keep the world informed and lubricated.

But some questions to be answered are;

Can all writings be regarded as informative?

How constructive and critical is one’s writeup?

How can someone’s writeup positively or adversely affect another individual’s life?

These questions ought to be considered while writing…….

To be a good writer necessitates absolute concentration, inspiration, brainstorming and reflective thinking. Most bloggers find the above questions very intriguing but yet these questions need to be answered for a hitch-free blogging.

If you are conscious of creating a successful and profitable blog site, you will definitely have to write down your ideas, read what others have written in the past, and reflect on your topic very often. The call to action is that you will invest countless number of hours to get to your destination.

Studies reveal that not all writeups are informative thus the need for individuals to ascertain their information source for accuracy. For a writeup to be informative, it must be constructive, critical, focused and readable.

People are faced with very busy life schedules and no one wants to spend time reading irrelevant or non-comprehensive articles. But a major concern is how to approach this issue? Will you start writing down any idea that comes to mind and assume that people will like it? Or will you carefully research your idea and see previous writeups on the topic so as to constructively structure your content and make it fascinating?

Thanks to internet, which has provided easy access to information. It can be difficult to ascertain if people will like one’s content however, google keyword research appears to be the solution. With google keyword search, a writer can easily establish the number of people searching for a particular topic in the search engines, and you can use it to compare your ideas with various searchable topics to gauge people’s interest.

Honestly, when I started blogging, I found it quite challenging putting down my ideas in a very constructive manner. However, with brainstorming, google keywords and knowledge share with great bloggers, I am presently improving on the later. I tried both, but I recommend and believe that the latter is the best option.

Bloggers are storytellers who “create stories out of no stories”! All bloggers should aim to write constructively, critically and credibly to attract audience, inform audience and positively affect people’s lives.

“Writers are power steerers with the ability to change the world”.
