<p>Hi,
My name is Blessing, I am a PhD candidate at the Cardiff Metropolitan University.  My research is focused on understanding the demand patterns and dimensions in supply chain using UK based companies as case studies.</p>

<p>Due to the varying customer demands and the volatility in the market,
retail stakeholders are faced with the difficulty of determining customer’s
needs at any particular point in time for maximum satisfaction and
of course, profit!</p>

<p>To a larger extent, the economic state has intensified the need for companies to indulge in supply chain process evaluation and improvements through efficient and effective planning for superior business performance. I will be analysing some current practices, key indicators, market activities, institutional arrangments to identify pathways to change, for accurate demand forecasts in supply chain.</p>

<p>I hold a Master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA) and a B.Sc degree in Parasitology &amp; Entomology. My personality, education and experience has enabled me to take on the challenges that life can present.</p>

<p>I am quite passionate and always optimistic to accept responsibilities as they present themselves at every stage in life so as to ever remain on top of my game. My ever burning desire to remain successful in life has remained my watch word,  hence my pragmatic approach to occurrences  and situations around me.</p>

<p>In my strive for fulfilment, I have embarked on some projects however, the latest project I am working on now is on my food blog website globalfoodbook.com where I share my cooking tips and blog about human health and food.</p>

<p>There is a popular saying thus;  “food is wealth” truly , but I see this as ‘tell me what you eat and I could possibly estimate your lifespan’. Apart from sharing my cooking tips, I also share some health tips for healthy living on the site.</p>

<p>I remain focused and optimistic, as I paddle my way through high waters.</p>

<p>I hope you find my site very educative and interesting!
Cheers</p>

<p>Blessing</p>
